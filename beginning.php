                            In 1946, <b>Mr. Earl Tupper</b> with his acumen, skill and innovative thinking, started a never-to-end revolution with Tupperware. 
                            Tupperware products created a need and space for practical and durable products. 
                            The brand made its debut about 75 years ago, it is still revolutionising lives across the world.

                            <b>Brownie Wise</b>, a remarkable American salesperson, was a pioneer of this revolution. 
                            She identified the need for product demos and introduced a party plan system, 
                            which ultimately created entrepreneurial opportunities for women. 
                            This system went on to break all records and made Tupperware a leading homeware brand across the globe. 
                            Tupperware is now sold in almost 100 countries. In almost seven decades, the products have become more diverse, 
                            environmentally-responsible and durable.
